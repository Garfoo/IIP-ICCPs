## Simple Summary:
This proposal recognizes that the current Illuvium Beyond design imposes limitations on smaller players and late comers. It proposes an intent and, while it suggests multiple ideas, ultimately empowers the team to decide how they wish to address this.
This proposal’s intent is to increase accessibility across the different demographics and reduce the current disadvantage of players that didn’t play since Set1 Wave1 by proposing various suggestions regarding the reward structure.
## Abstract:
The intent of this proposal is to increase accessibility across the different demographics and mitigate the existing disadvantage faced by latecomers. To achieve this, several ideas are suggested here:
1) Compartmentalizing the rewards in 2 groups. Set rewards and wave rewards.
2) Implement a function to choose which leaderboard(s) you want to participate in.
3) Increasing the overall number of leaderboard spots.
4) Planning ahead an incremental extension of the total allocated rewards.
## Overview:
1) Compartmentalization of the rewards.
The rewards would be divided into 2 different groups: one for individual sets, and one more for individual waves. This division would help to keep the game fresh, enhance accessibility for smaller players and late comers and lay the foundation for the following ideas. 
2) Choosing the leaderboard(s) you want to participate in.
The idea of compartmentalizing the rewards by itself would only help so much to enhance the accessibility for smaller players and latecomers as the bigger sections would overlap on the others. Top performers in the total leaderboard would also naturally be top performers in individual sets and waves leaderboard.
Implementing a function where players choose which leaderboard(s) they want to join would encourage those who are more fortunate to compete in the bigger leaderboards, while also providing an opportunity for smaller players and latecomers to participate in Beyond and even have a shot at earning rewards.
3) Increasing the overall number of leaderboard spots.
Most likely to naturally occur by compartmentalizing the rewards into different leaderboards, having more leaderboard spots overall is a great way to attract more players. A delicate balance must be achieved here. While having more leaderboard spots incentivize more players, it’s also crucial to maintain incentives for top players as much as possible.
4) Incremental extension of the rewards.
Naturally being an expansive game with additional sets and waves in perpetuity, as we release more and more new waves, the total reward allocation would have to increase to maintain interest and continue to attract newcomers.
With compartmentalized reward sections, it is possible to proactively plan an extension of the overall allocated rewards. The suggested idea here is to implement an incremental, predetermined increase in rewards as we progress through the new Illuvitar waves and sets.
## Rational:
As of now, being only at Set 1 Wave 2, we can already observe how Illuvium Beyond’s design poses limitations for smaller players and late comers.The entry threshold to the rewarded portion of the leaderboard is very high for small players and discouraging for those who wish to start playing now. As we advance through the waves and potentially, in the future, have the first waves of Illuvitar get more expensive, the barrier to entry will only get bigger and bigger.   
The recent price revision of Illuvitar’s Disks attempted to make the product more accessible. However, the community opinion was greatly divided. The central question was whether it is best to have the product for web3 collectors or the web2 casual gamers that the rest of the Illuvium ecosystem is aiming to attract.
The suggested ideas to rework Illuvium Beyond reward structure and the intent of this proposal aim to address that question by making Illuvium Beyond more accessible and appealing to our web2 casual gamers, while retaining the high-end collector aspect for the web3 demographic.
Ultimately, this revision of the reward structure aims to increase the accessibility of the game in a sustainable manner, consequently boosting revenue generated from Illuvitar and enhancing the Illuvium Beyond experience for all.
Please remember that this proposal proposes an intent only and while it suggests multiple ideas, it ultimately empowers the team to decide how they wish to fulfill the intent.
Upon passing, this proposal stipulates that Illuvium Labs will prepare and present a solution to the community for voting.
