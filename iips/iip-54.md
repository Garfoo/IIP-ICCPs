## Simple Summary:
This IIP modifies IIP-39 by proposing a synchronised launch of all Illuvium gamesâ€”Illuvium Zero, Overworld, and Arena. While the original plan was to release Illuvium Zero ahead of the other games, this adjustment acknowledges that simultaneous releases are necessary given current constraints. 

## Abstract:
Instead of launching Illuvium Zero before the Overworld, as previously proposed in IIP-39, all three games will be released together. Subsequent updates will introduce blueprint minting and Mega Cities, with compensatory measures to account for these delays.

## Overview:
This proposal modifies IIP-39 by changing the launch strategy of Illuvium Zero from pre-release to a synchronised release with Overworld and Arena. The phased introduction of features like Blueprint minting and Mega Cities ensures ongoing development and player engagement.

Key Points:
- Unified Launch: Illuvium Zero, Overworld, and Arena will launch together. 
- Free to Play Mode: The launch will include Free to Play mode across all platforms.
- Blueprint and Dye Minting Delay: Blueprint minting and Podarium features will be available approximately 6-8 weeks post-launch.
- Mega Cities Delay: Mega Cities will follow approximately 8-12 weeks post-launch, with a compensatory fuel multiplier.
- Fuel Multiplier: To compensate for the delayed Mega City release, plots held by a single address that could be used to form a Mega City will receive a temporary boost to Fuel production: a 25% boost for plots that could form a 2x2 Mega City, and 50% for plots that could form a 3x3 Mega City. This boost is not cumulative and will be applied to Fuel sales in the Fuel Exchange, not in-game. The boost will be removed once the Mega City feature is released.
- Fuel Crate Distribution: An additional Fuel Crate will be distributed before launch to ensure initial fuel availability.

## Rationale:
Illuvium Labs can only deliver as quickly as the proposed timeline. Although it could be better, this is the only timeline available to prevent delaying all games and risking the DAO potentially missing out on favourable market conditions.
