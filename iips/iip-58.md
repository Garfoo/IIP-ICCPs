## Simple Summary:
Restructure the holo-airdrop points to be more aligned with the previous point system in regards of amount and variance.

## Introduction:
We all appreciate the chance to be part of the Illuvium universe and are grateful for the opportunity to earn while testing the game.

A marketing campaign like the airdrop event can be an important tool to attract new users and to encourage users to invest more time into a game that will reset the entire progress in due time. With these incentives a company implies that the time a user puts into the project will be rewarded consistently by receiving a **fair** share of the reward pool for their invested time. As a result of this unspoken promise the company has the responsibility to ensure that the points are distributed in a fair, transparent and consistent manner. This behavior leads to a mutual agreement between users and company and ensures that new players are rewarded equally for their invested time. In other words, it doesn’t matter if a person starts playing at the beginning of the airdrop or at the end because the amount gained per hour does decrease for everybody equally based on the number of competitors and their invested time.

## Objective/Abstract:
This proposal aims to ensure that the current and future airdrop structures are monitored more accurately in regards to coherence, consistency and the general points of the concept written in the introduction.

## Overview:
A game which is in the testing phase is bound to experience a series of changes in a short period of time. Therefore, it can be necessary to restructure the point distribution to give new users a fair start and to respect the time long-term users already invested into the airdrop.

Furthermore, the reward structure should aim to incentivize users to invest time into key parts of the game like testing of the general gameloop, which is the target for the release. This doesn’t seem to be the case by pushing users to ignore everything in the game but holos.

Lastly, it is important to not turn an airdrop into an extreme raffle by increasing the variance unnecessarily. This ensures that users are truly rewarded for their efforts and based on their luck.

Sadly, the newest announcement regarding holo-airdrop-points showed little to no grasp of this concept. Even more it showed that the right intentions can lead to damaging results.

## Conclusion/Rationale - Current Airdrop:
The airdrop points for holo-Illuvials need to be aligned with the average points a user received per hour during the last patch. Furthermore, the variance for airdrop points should equally be brought down to the previous reasonable amount. Surely, it isn’t possible or necessary to calculate this precisely. A rough internal estimation will be sufficient. The factor between airdrop points and invested time should be aimed to roughly be around 1.0 – 2.5 between changes (Meaning if users receive 10 points per hour during one patch, that would mean the next patch should hand out 25 points per hour at a maximum). Of course this is only a rough direction and doesn’t need to be calculated because that would just be wasteful in regards of time resources. With a factor above 1.0 new users will be awarded more per hour and therefore attracted to start playing even at the end of the airdrop phase. On the other hand, a factor below 2.5 ensures that the time veteran users invested is still valued and avoids causing upsetting veteran users by implementing a soft reset on invested time.  

## Conclusion/Rationale - Future Airdrops:
Keep the concepts described in this IIP in mind and internally formulate plans for future airdrops and structure changes regarding rewards based on airdrops in advance if possible.
