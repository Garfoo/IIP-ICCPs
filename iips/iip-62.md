## Summary:
This proposal aims to simplify the onboarding process for new players by removing the mandatory Overworld (OW) tutorial and cinematic, allowing direct access to Arena gameplay. This adjustment will lower the entry barrier and enhance the overall player experience, particularly for TFT and TCG community members who we aim to onboard.

## Overview:
* Objective: Enable new players to access Arena gameplay directly without having to go through the OW tutorial and the cinematic scene.

* Implementation:
  - Make it obvious that the cinematic can be skipped with the space bar.
  - Ensure players only go through the OW tutorial when they enter the OW for the first time.

* Benefits: Improved first-time player experience, increased retention, and focused engagement on Arena.

## Rationale:
While current players enjoy the full Illuvium ecosystem, simplifying the onboarding process is essential to attract new players who might be deterred by the initial complexity.

Our primary focus should be on selling the game before the pack opening (OW). The goal is to attract people to play Arena first. A portion of these players will then want to compete, own assets, and get skins to show off, which will drive their interest in the OW or make them buy off the market, driving demand for people to continue to play in the OW. By prioritizing Arena gameplay, we can quickly capture the interest of new players and encourage them to explore the Illuvium ecosystem further.
