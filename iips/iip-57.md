## Simple Summary:
This proposal aims to limit airdrop points obtainable by Sepolia ETH whales by excluding purchased Tier 5 Stage 3 Illuvials from the Open Beta (testnet) P2A. The goal is to ensure that airdrop points are awarded to individuals who are actively playing the game while maintaining a healthy Illuvial economy. Only Tier 5 Stage 3 Illuvials that were minted (via capture or fusion) in that wallet will be eligible for airdrop points.

## Overview:
Tier 5 Stage 3 Illuvials are the rarest and most sought-after in the game. Players often spend hundreds of hours exploring the overworld and may only encounter a few of these in the wild. Alternatively, they can be obtained through fusion, a process that requires extensive play time to level up an illuvial sufficiently. The challenge of collecting a complete set of Tier 5 illuvials is reflected in the play-to-airdrop point system, where a Tier 5 completion bonus awards 39,000 pointsâ€”more than twice the 15,000 points given for capturing the other 180+ illuvials. 

Currently, players can claim 0.1 sepETH per day through the game. However, there are other methods to obtain larger amounts of sepETH, such as through faucets, mining, or purchasing it outright. This has enabled sepETH whales to circumvent the significant playtime required to acquire these rare illuvials by purchasing straight off the Illuvidex, completing the high airdrop point Tier 5 lines without even venturing into the overworld. Consequently, this will reduce the ILV token rewards allocated to players who are genuinely investing time and effort in testing the beta. 

In the recent town hall, Kieran highlighted the benefits of sepETH purchases, noting that they have added value to the illuvials and provided valuable data on a real illuvial economy. Additionally, players who regularly exhaust their 0.1 sepETH daily allocation have benefited by being able to sell their caught Illuvials for more sepETH that can be used to increase their playtime.

## Rationale:
This approach ensures that players actively playing and testing the game receive the majority of the airdrop points as intended. The allocation for sepETH buyers will likely be reduced but not completely eliminated, as they can still complete lower tiers. 

All non-Tier 5 Stage 3 illuvials will still maintain their value on the DEX, as they can still be actively traded for collection completions. This will continue to provide valuable economic data to the Illuvium team and ensure that players remain engaged with the Illuvidex. 

This proposal maintains the benefits that sepETH buyers bring to the ecosystem. Many players struggle with the daily 0.1 sepETH claim and depend on selling illuvials to extend their playtime. This system will allow them to continue selling their non-Tier 5 Stage 3 illuvials to sepETH buyers. However, these buyers will now need to invest playtime themselves if they want to achieve the highest tier completion bonuses, just like everyone else.

## Conclusion:
Removing only the Tier 5 Stage 3 illuvials (that are not in the wallet they were minted in) from eligibility for the airdrop campaign will ensure that players actively testing the game receive their fair share of rewards. This approach also maintains the value of the majority of illuvials and allows for an effective test of a real Illuvidex economy.
