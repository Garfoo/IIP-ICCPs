## Summary
We currently have four committees surrounding the IMC: Marketing, Game Design, Strategy, and Operations. With the launch of our competitive scene, this proposal suggests introducing an Esports Committee as a fifth committee to assist the IMC and the Team in this area.

## Overview
Formation:

The Esports Committee will, like the existing committees, consist of five industry experts.

Appointment:

Committee members will be nominated by ILV token holders and appointed by the IMC. Selections will be based on expertise, knowledge, and a vested interest in the project. Due to the potential access to confidential information, all committee members will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) shortly after their appointment.

Role:

The Esports Committee will provide expert advice to the IMC and the Team, ensuring decisions are well-informed and carefully considered. This committee will focus on developing the esports programs and offering expert guidance on all aspects of the competitive scene within Illuvium.

## Rationale
The competitive scene in the Arena is the driving force of the Illuvium ecosystem. Our tokenomics model, which reserves 1 million ILV for the in-game reward pool, is a significant asset for onboarding new players. With the launch of Illuvium and the Arena games nearing readiness, it's time to prepare the competitive scene.

Players from our target audience have high standards, and first impressions are critical. Establishing an Esports Committee will help Illuvium build and nurture a strong competitive scene, attracting new players and generating additional revenue for our ecosystem.
