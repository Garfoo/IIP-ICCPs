## Simple Summary:
The objective of this proposal is to ensure that airdrop rewards structures cannot change during a given airdrop campaign. If changes do need to be made during a campaign, a subperiod will be created to reward players based on the original rules.

## Overview:
Once rules for an airdrop are announced, any point structures, timelines or token amounts specified for the airdrop may not change, except under the following conditions.

1) The rules may change if a new subperiod is utilized.

2) A new subperiod means that the timing for the new ruleset will be announced ahead of time, a snapshot will be taken of existing point values, and players will receive airdrop points based on their performance during the sub-periods corresponding to the rulesets during those subperiods.

3) The reward weight of a subperiod should be proportional to the subperiod’s length. If a subperiod lasts for ⅓ of an airdrop campaign, ⅓ of the rewards should be allocated to that subperiod.

4) Exploits and bugs are exceptions to this proposal. A pause in airdrop points, or other actions might be necessary to rectify extreme scenarios. In this event, the overall spirit of this proposal should be followed retroactively, utilizing snapshot subperiods to reward legitimate players as fairly as possible.

## Scope:
Airdrop campaigns which include in-game activities starting with the Season 2 of the testnet airdrop.

## Rationale:
A marketing campaign like the airdrop event can be an important tool to attract new users and to encourage users to invest more time into a game. With these incentives a company implies that the time a user puts into the project will be rewarded consistently by receiving a fair share of the reward pool for their invested time. As a result of this unspoken promise the company has the responsibility to ensure that the points are distributed in a fair, transparent and consistent manner. This leads to a mutual agreement between users and company and ensures that new players are rewarded equally for their invested time.This IIP creates a framework that structures airdrop campaigns in a way that benefits all participants, shareholders and creators of the Illuvium eco-system by introducing subperiods without restricting ILV-labs.
