## Objective:
Include In-App purchases in calculations for rewards for the Alliance Program.

## Summary:
Currently only ETH revenue is calculated for Alliance Program rewards, but this excludes revenue from one of Illuvium core games. Currently Illuvium Zero revenue comes solely from in-app purchases, but there may be other future titles that take advantage of this.

## Overview:
Mobile app stores do take a percentage of the revenue, upwards of 30%. I suggest using 70% of the revenue generated for Alliance Program rewards, but would leave it up to the team to come up with a number between 50% and 70% based on any additional costs that are associated with in-app purchases.

Mobile purchases are made with local currency so at the end of each Alliance Program pay period these local currencies will be converted to ETH. This ETH will be added to direct ETH sales to determine Alliance Program Tier status and rewards.

## Rationale:
Creators should be incentivized to make content and promote all areas/games of the Illuvium ecosystem and currently there is no incentive for Illuvium ZERO. This will be increasingly more important if there would be a push for free to play gamers to play ZERO.
