## Simple Summary:
Change the individual stretch goals rewards from ‘number of D1sks bought’ to ‘points earned per D1sk bought’ where Mega D1sks give five times more points than the Standard D1sks. Alternate the cumulative rewards between Mega D1sks and Standard D1sk and re-introduce rewards for the 5,000 and 10,000 points threshold.

## Abstract:
This proposal intends to address three main issues with the individual stretch goals rewards:

The disproportionate incentive between buying Mega D1sks and Standard D1sks. This would be fixed by changing the rewards structure from ‘number of D1sks bought’ to 'points earned per D1sk bought' where buying a Mega D1sk gives five times more points than buying a Standard D1sk.

The slightly over-tuned cumulative future wave rewards and the corresponding dilution of only one type of D1sk (Mega D1sks). This would be fixed by alternating the cumulative future wave rewards between Mega D1sks and Standard D1sks.

The lack of higher threshold rewards for the top buyers. This would be fixed with the re-introduction of rewards for the 5,000 and 10,000 points threshold (1,000 Mega D1sks and 2,000 Mega D1sks or 5,000 Standard D1sks and 10,000 Standard D1sks).

## Overview:
1.	In wave 2, there was a reward of 1 Mega D1sk for every 25 D1sks bought. This created a very disproportionate incentive between buying Mega D1sks and Standard D1sks and made buyers feel like they were losing value by not buying Standard D1sks. This can be solved with the introduction of a Mega D1sk multiplier. By adding a 5x point multiplier for buying a Mega D1sk we remove the disproportional incentive to buy Standard D1sks and balance the incentive for both types of D1sks. 

The feedback from the community was that they loved the introduction of cumulative rewards and that it was an excellent addition to the individual stretch goals that made them buy more D1sks than what they were originally intending to. The implementation of a simple change such as alternating the type of free D1sks given will help to avoid diluting only the future supply of Mega D1sks but of Standard D1sks as well. This will also help tone down the overall rewards being distributed. For example, if in wave 3 someone buys 10 Mega D1sks, that would equate to 50 points which would get them one free Standard D1sk and one free Mega D1sk, whereas before it would give no bonus D1sk.

3.	Higher threshold rewards were present in wave 1 with the reward, “User can design and name a plant in the Overworld '' at 10,000 D1sks and the “User can design and name an illuvitar accessory variation for wave 2“ at 20,000 D1sks. The re-introduction of these levels of threshold rewards would not only disincentivize players from having multiple wallets but would also reward those who really push Beyond to the limit as well. It is up to the team to decide on the rewards given. The Ranger Suit skin and Holo Battle Board can be pushed to a higher threshold or they can create additional rewards for the 5,000 and 10,000 point threshold like there were in wave 1.

## Rationale:
1.	The cumulative rewards in the individual stretch goals felt very punishing for buying Mega D1sks as it promoted only the Standard D1sks, thus the change to a ‘points earned per D1sk bought’ with different multipliers for both D1sks. This 5x multiplier resulted from various discussions between the community where the majority agreed that this multiplier should correspond roughly to the difference in price between Standard D1sks and Mega D1sks (1/6 ratio), but in order to maintain the previous rewards structure of getting 1 free D1sk for every 25 D1sks bought we propose the points multiplier for the Mega D1sks to be 5x for consistency and simplicity sake.

2.	For wave 3 there will be around 5900 Mega D1sks distributed for free. This will equate to roughly 20% of the total wave 2 mega D1sks sold... By alternating rewards this will balance these numbers a bit between Standards D1sks and Megas D1sks. This would mean for wave 3 that for every 50 Standard D1sks or 10 Mega D1sks you would get one free wave 4 Mega D1sk and one free wave 4 Standard D1sk. Ideally keeping a similar structure as it was with wave 2 where you would get a free wave 4 Standard D1sk at the 25, 75, 125, 175, etc... and a free wave 4 Mega D1sk at the 50, 100, 150, 200, etc... points threshold.

3.	With the multiplier change in points that this proposal suggests, having the highest reward for 1,000 points won’t be as rare as it was with wave 2 since Mega D1sks now give five times more points than what they previously did. 20,000 D1sks was a bit of a stretch and since no one reached that milestone on wave 1 that's probably why it was removed for wave 2. But with this change to ‘points earned per D1sk bought’ it makes sense to re-introduce some kind of reward at least for the 5,000 and 10,000 threshold. This has the potential to give that extra incentive to the top players to do some extra buying in order to reach these prized rewards. 

## Conclusion:
These three changes will help promote a good balance and hopefully bring some consistency and drive even more sales for future waves. If nothing is done to the current cumulative rewards these will add major sell pressure on the secondary market and will just devalue the overall perceived value of illuvitars. These changes will make wave 3 healthier and more balanced while still being able to maintain the cumulative bonuses and allowing this feature to continue for the next three waves in set 1 so that we avoid distributing an insane amount of free D1sks.
