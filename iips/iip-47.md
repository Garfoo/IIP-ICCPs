## Simple Summary:
Change the remaining Illuvium Beyond set 1 wave’s duration from three months to four months and have the gap period between waves be adjustable by the team. This will be best to sync Illuvium Beyond with Illuvium Overworld set 1 and increase the flexibility of the promotional partnerships.

## Abstract:
Given the Open Beta launch has been delayed and Illuvium Beyond wave 3 is now on a stalemate regarding its release date, this proposal aims to better align the Illuvium Beyond timeline with Overworld set 1 and try to avoid a large period without any sales between illuvial sets. To achieve this we suggest changing the remaining set 1 wave interval from a fixed one month to a flexible period that’ll be adjustable by the team. This, paired with an Increase of the remaining set 1 wave’s duration from three to four months which was an idea that the majority of the community voted on a poll made in the Beyond discord will help time the promotional partnerships with an active wave running to prevent the problem that happened during wave 2.

## Overview:
The team has mentioned that they intend for the Overworld set 1 illuvials to last around one year. 

Team expected duration for set 1:

As things stand we’re missing three Beyond waves to finish set 1. If nothing is done and the wave’s duration remain the same this will mean Illuvium Beyond set 1 will finish in: 

3 * 3 months + 3 * 1 month = 12 months

If IIP-XX (Wave 3 Release Date) is passed this will mean that Beyond wave 3 will be released one month prior to the Open Beta launch. Thus making Illuvium Beyond end one month prior to Overworld set 1.

Increasing the wave's duration by one month and making its intervals adjustable will give the team more flexibility with the promotional partnerships as well as help synchronize the pace of Beyond with the pace of Overworld. This change was suggested from a poll made within the community where the majority voted that they would like to have the wave's duration be four months.

Community poll:

If we extend the wave’s duration to 4 months and have its intervals vary between one week to one month we get the following timelines:

3 * 4 months + 3 * 1 week = 12 months and 3 weeks
3 * 4 months + 3 * 1 month = 15 months

This way the team has room to accommodate for any unexpected delays that the Overworld set 1 might have and If they reduce the interval between waves to one week it would mean that Illuvium Beyond would end one week prior to the end of Overworld set 1. Having a minimal interval between waves is important but it will be up to the team to decide on that.

On a final note, the details about the misprint auction that’ll happen by the end of Illuvium Beyond set 1 are still unknown in terms of its structure or how long it will last. But probably at least a week should be saved for this auction sale.

## Rational:
We've now had wave 1 for three months and wave 2 for nearly six months with different intervals between waves, therefore we should strive to define a fixed duration for the remaining waves. This will help establish consistency and have a good pace for the remaining Illuvium Beyond set 1 while also trying to synchronize it with the Overworld set 1.

Wave 2 showed that a longer wave period can be healthy and profitable for the DAO, as the illuvium beyond sales remained consistent throughout the wave extension. The community has also shared that they appreciated wave 2 having a longer duration making it a more chill and less rushed experience as it was with wave 1. 

Extending the wave’s duration one more month could also help prevent what happened in wave 2 where the promotion partnership got delayed so it would coincide with the Illuvium Arena launch and it ended up extending wave 2 duration for nearly three more months.


One crucial aspect of Illuvium Beyond as a product is its continuity, an undefined pause like the one we’re having right now should be avoided at all cost, nevertheless having a minimal interval between waves is also important for different reasons.

Here are the main points regarding the importance of having a minimal break between waves:

- It gives buyers time to prepare their funds for the next wave. IMX transactions show that a large percentage of D1sks are purchased on the last 7 days of the wave as well as in the beginning with the Alpha sale.

- It gives time for the team to implement the changes on the front-end and back-end.

- It gives time for a good marketing campaign

- It gives the secondary market time to breathe.

- It builds up excitement for the next wave and its initial Alpha sale.

## Conclusion:
Until a new set is released, waves of four months would be a good pace for the rest of Beyond set 1. Beyond should be intrinsically connected to the Overworld and they should keep pace with each other. With this proposal we define the length of the remaining waves to match the community preference and give the team the liberty to adjust the interval between waves to better synchronize Beyond with the Overworld.
