## Abstract:
This proposal addresses a significant exploit in Illuvium's Survival Mode. Players can share successful gameplay videos, allowing others to replicate their strategies and unfairly earn airdrop points. We propose making Survival Mode dynamic to prevent this, ensuring unique game setups for every player. Additionally, we will remove all Survival Mode milestones and any points earned in Season One to restore fairness. This IIP aims to maintain the integrity and competitive balance of the game.

## Simple Summary:
We propose making Survival Mode dynamic to address an exploit in Survival Mode that allows players to copy successful strategies from shared videos. This change will ensure unique game setups, preventing replication of the exact strategy. We will remove Survival Mode milestones and any points earned in Season One to maintain fairness.

## Overview:
We discovered that players can record and share videos of successful Survival Mode runs, enabling others to replicate these runs exactly and unfairly earn airdrop points. To counteract this, we will introduce a dynamic system in Survival Mode where each game setup is unique. This change will take some time to implement, so we will also remove Survival Mode milestones and any points earned in Season One to ensure fairness.

## Rationale:
1. **Exploit Discovery:** The current system allows players to share successful gameplay videos, leading to unfair point accumulation.
2. **Dynamic Game Setups:** Introducing randomised elements to Survival Mode will prevent the exact replication of strategies.
3. **Fairness:** Removing milestones and points from Survival Mode in Season One will ensure that players who have used the exploit do not have an advantage over other players.

This proposal aligns with IIP-58-R, which emphasises the importance of a coherent and consistent airdrop structure. By addressing the exploit and ensuring fair distribution of rewards, we uphold the integrity and transparency of the airdrop campaign. Just as IIP-58-R ensures that reward structures cannot change mid-campaign without proper subperiods, this proposal ensures that the competitive balance is maintained by rectifying an exploit, thereby protecting the interests of legitimate players.
