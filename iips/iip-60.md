## Simple Summary:
This document outlines a new proposal type, including the format and specifications for Gameplay Feature Proposals (GFP). Gameplay Feature Proposals will be used by the community for two purposes:
1) Modifications to existing gameplay systems.
2) Additions of new gameplay features.

## Overview:
Gameplay Feature Proposals will outline a high level idea for a gameplay feature or modification. GFPs will have an open-ended timeline for implementation. Due to the nature of gameplay features, any specified element may need to be adjusted at the discretion of Illuvium Labs during development, with no limitations.

## Flow:
Going from ideation to implementation will be a double approval process. The steps required are outlined below:
1) A community member posts a GFP for community review and upvoting.
2) Council voting takes place. An approval at this step moves to step 3, while a rejection stops the process.
3) Idea is added to the planned feature list.
4) Labs will present a high-level GDD outlining their preferred implementation. This GDD is also subject to community review and upvoting.
5) Council voting takes place. An approval at this step gives Labs a green light to move ahead with development.

## Voting:
Gameplay Feature Proposals will be posted with the GFP tag (ex. GFP-XX) in the Governance Ideas channel. Upon reaching 40 upvotes from the community, with more upvotes than downvotes, GFPs will move through normal proposal voting by the Illuvium Community Council and Illuvium Main Council. The upvote requirement to initiate council voting can be changed in the future by ICCP, as Illuvium’s player numbers fluctuate.

## Approval:
On being approved, GFPs will be added to a planned feature list, for Illuvium Labs to integrate into their development pipeline.

## Cancellation:
Occasionally, a GFP may be passed, and during development or prototyping, it becomes apparent that the feature will not be possible to implement. This could be for technical reasons, economic reasons, or simply that the feature isn’t fun to play. In this scenario, the gameplay feature may be cancelled, with accompanying communication about the reason for the cancellation posted in the proposal thread.

## Rationale:
Game design demands more fluidity than can be offered through the DAO’s normal proposal processes. Proposals are the equivalent of law within the Illuvium ecosystem, and law doesn’t make sense for game features or systems, where there needs to be space to iterate and adjust features based on what’s fun, or economically successful, or technically feasible. GFPs create that space with a more dynamic category of proposal, while creating a more accessible format for the community to contribute their ideas. Not being strictly tied to specification put forward by the author optimizes the possibility that proposals related to gameplay features can be passed by council, can be successfully developed by Labs, and will arrive in a fun and playable state for players.

The two approval process is chosen to ensure overall community preferences and thoughts about a gameplay feature are being represented. The first vote serves as a temperature check for the community’s thoughts on the idea for the gameplay feature. This temperature check ensures the DAO is not tasking Labs with extraneous work that may be discarded. The second vote ensures that an actionable feature is being put forward and voted upon, and helps to ensure that overall community expectations are being met with the feature.

## Gameplay Feature Proposal Template:
**Simple Summary:** One or two sentences outlining the core feature to be added or adjusted.

**Overview:** A description of all the author’s ideas around the gameplay feature or changes to be made. This section should focus on what the feature is and what it does.

**Economic Integration (Optional):** The author’s ideas around how the gameplay feature can fit into the DAO’s economic model.

**Interoperability (Optional):** The author’s ideas around how the gameplay feature can integrate assets or utilize or enhance features from other Illuvium games.

**Rationale:** The author’s ideas on why the gameplay feature or changes will improve the player experience. This section should focus on why the feature or changes are needed.
