## Abstract:
This proposal will enable Illuvium Labs to mint up to $15,000 USD worth of prizes consisting of Emote D1sks, Cosmetics (Like Battleboards & skins) and a range of Fuel crates each month. This will be distributed as prizes during Illuvium sanctioned in-game events.

## Overview:
Every single month, Illuvium Labs can mint any number of Fuel Crates or emote D1sks as long as their value doesn’t exceed $15,000. These NFTs must be used during gaming events, whether for giveaways, participation prizes, podium prizes, or any other relevant reason.

For total transparency, the quantity of items minted should be disclosed to the Council and Community in an appropriate manner at the end of every month.

Any leftover spend will not be rolled over to subsequent months.

## Rationale:
Illuvium has been sponsoring community-hosted events for the past six months, such as the Illuvial hunts by Hyperion and Phantom and past Ascendant tournaments hosted by Phantom and Wildfire. Although these have seen varying success, the recent hunts have garnered large community support and seen growing crowds over the past weeks.

Although Labs could continue distributing ILV as prizes, it makes more sense in terms of player retention to use other NFTs and prizes for the events as well. Fuel crates would enable winners to further explore the Overworld and even help newer participants build up their Illuvium team through exploration.

## Conclusion:
Illuvium’s strong point has always been its IP. By extension, using things like Emote D1sks and extra ‘gameplay time’ as prizes for events makes a lot of sense in driving new and existing users further into the Illuvium marketing funnel.
