## Introduction
Illuvium ecosystem's magic experience depends on its game's interoperability. Each game's economy and revenue depends on the other ones. We basically have lands in Illuvium-Zero creating fuel to start things off. This fuel holds value as players engage with Illuvium-Overworld, utilizing it to cure shards, craft armaments, and capture illuvials. The prices of these assets, and thus the overall Overworld experience, depend on the demand and use case for them in the third game, Illuvium-Arena. Ultimately, the strength of motivation for players to invest in their teams and excel in the Arena lies in the rewards it offers.

## Objective
This proposal aims to ensure we get Arena rewards back for the Open Beta launch so that the game is in a competitive state and the whole ecosystem comes alive.

## Rationale:
The competitive side of the Arena is a key component of our ecosystem. Here's a more visual representation of our ecosystem chain:

(Illuvium-Zero → Illuvium Overworld → Illuvium Arena → Arena Reward) = 
Interoperable magic experience, incentive to grind all games, more revenue to the DAO

If any component in this chain is missing, the entire chain breaks, and we don't achieve optimal results. More directly, every one of those components directly depends on the next one at its right. Arena rewards, being on the far right, is at the top of the chain. Without a competitive Arena, the entire ecosystem loses its purpose and fails to achieve its goals.

## Conclusion
After more than 3 years of development, Illuvium is finally about to launch with its Open Beta. This is going to be Illuvium's most important moment in its history.

Web3 is early, in fact so early that Illuvium is going to be the first real, sustainable, AAA game out there. Being in this innovative specific sector, the user acquisition is very high. Even with the best game by miles, people in web3, for now, only follow the money.

We attract people's attention with our big airdrop, that's amazing, but our goal here is not to just be another money farm. Our goal is to attract people so that they can fully engage with the Illuvium ecosystem and truly fall in love with it. To offer this enchanting experience, Arena rewards are indispensable.

Having Arena rewards on launch will ensure we give the best first possible experience to all new players. It will also give us better user retention and better revenue, which will lead to the most positive headlines and start the snowball effect.
