## Objectives:
1. Minimize the potential conflicts of interest due to a lack of fair disclosures between any of the following parties and Illuvium Labs: Landholders, Founders, Venture Capitalists, Main Council, Department Heads, Lead Core Contributors, Core Contributors, and/or any Sub-Councils.
2. Define the fair disclosures for Illuvium Labs to supply Illuvium Landholders as it pertains to game mechanics and all relevant variables that impact the management of Illuvium Land NFTs. Establish a regular reporting standard between Illuvium Labs and Landholders.
3. Define the appropriate information required for Illuvium Zero patch notes with each update.

## Overview:
***"I definitely agree. We have all spent a lot of money upfront, and it is going on two years now. So we need to do whatever we can to not only make the game better, but make people want to buy land plots."***

-Kieran | Illuvium, July 2024 Illuvium Town Hall.

Disclosures and accountability help create a fair and level playing field for all participants. By Illuvium Labs consistently disclosing any pertinent information necessary for Landholders to manage their lands (NFT assets) optimally, everyone has access to the same facts on which to base their Illuivum land management. To not disclose such information, invites suspicion as to who has the information and how it could be used to influence the Illuvium economy with this privilege.

Landholder ignorance of any production or expense variables can negatively impact his/her NFT output performance, this could lead to pursuing a strategy that conflicts with and/or does not align with the logic of the game designed by Illuvium Labs. This may lead to opportunity cost and what some Landholders might interpret as financial harm. This is both unnecessary and adds unwarranted risk to the Landholders, the IMC, and the DAO. By Landholders experiencing lower returns and greater risks it discourages future Land sales, negatively impacting Labs and the DAO.

Disclosing the quantitative model of the input, output, and duration variables allows for non-speculative game play and will accelerate quality feedback for the development time while the game is in its beta state.

## Recommendations:
1. **Fair Disclosure Standards** to be fulfilled by Illuvium Labs by curating and sharing any relevant information related to the game mechanics and all variables that impact the management of Illuvium Land NFTs that impact the production of elements, fuel, or any future ETH-producing activity. 
*Appendix A lists recommended disclosures from the contributors.
2. **Landholder Sponsor** to be named by to interface with the IMC, ICC, and Illuvium Labs, serving as the primary point of contact for efficient and orderly communication to streamline the initial disclosure reporting and ongoing reporting.
3. **Original Fair Disclosure Standards** are to be drafted by the ICC and Landholder Sponsor working in collaboration with the appointed Illuvium Labs representative for accountability related to fair disclosures. Non-technical Landholders should be able to access and easily interpret such reporting so they can manage their land under a prudent standard.
4. **Regular Reporting** by Illuvium Labs will be supplied that impacts the original disclosure and any additional relevant disclosures related to the game’s mechanics that impact the management of Illuvium Land NFTs. The goal is to reach a state that Johnny | Illuvium indicated is feasible with APIs that make this information readable, available, and accessible. Until on-demand reporting is implemented, all changes must be accompanied by patch notes 5 days prior to going live. Changes and the patch notes that accompany them can have impacts on in-game economies; therefore making sure announcements of changes are consistent and timely is important.

## Feasibility
This proposal recognizes that API’s are a feasible means to fulfill such disclosures and that per the IMC an existing action exists for Illuvium Labs. By including a Landholder sub-council’s engagement in this process it can provide better helpful feedback from a Landholder’s perspective and representation from the Landholder community who have captilized such work.

Johnny | Illuvium has confirmed the technical capabilities exist by Illuvium Labs to be able to support the recommendations as requested in this proposal.

*"In the meantime we have made some data available in our own formats via git repo to partners. Zero data could be added here (not sure if it is or isn't right now). It's basically 'take it as it is'. It might be reasonable to make this widely accessible. But that is really not my call any more. https://github.com/NickJordan289/pyilz"*

In the interim, pragmatic and sufficient disclosures need to take place to honor Landholder’s assets. Neglecting or failing to do so could have significant unintended consequences.

## Rationale:
Illuvium Zero Land are digital assets (NFTs) that incorporate a gaming set of features. Our contributors believes Land NFTs are a unique asset in the Illuvium universe because the intent is to generate ETH, therefore, changes in gameplay mechanics can have significant ramifications. In addition, Zero serves as the economic engine for the entire interoperability gaming experience with all of the other Illuvium gaming dependent and influenced by it.

## Conclusion:
Full disclosures to Landholders will benefit the Illuvium ecosystem by:
1. Raising sentiment and increasing the investor appeal for future land sales.
2. Restoring confidence in Land NFTs and helping to enhance future collaboration with the rest of the ecosystem.
3. Minimizing the potential conflicts of interest amongst various Illuvium stakeholders.
4. Optimizing the production of fuel, blueprints, dyes, and training centers to enhance the overall gaming experience for all users.
5. Creating a proactive and constructive feedback source for the Zero core development team that helps refine the economic engine for the entire ecosystem.

## Appendix A
* Building costs and time needed for upgrades. @Dr.Spoon
* Cost of fuel extraction and active element/fuel conversions at all structure levels. @Mozeen
* Calculations for the output of extractors and converters at various efficient levels.  @Dr.Spoon
* Passive converter generation time between granting partial amounts, if that timing ever changes for building level or efficiency, and how those partial amounts are calculated based on efficiency, including the rounding mechanism. @Mozeen
* The maximum cap of paths bonus and how it applies to the land plot functionally. @Dr.Spoon
* Cost for dye crafting and any relevant tactical and operational details. @Dr.Spoon
* Details related to blueprint generation and scarcity bounding curve. @VP | YouTube
* Differentiation and rarity of Labs’ generated blueprints versus Land-based blueprints. @VP | YouTube
* Impact of science structure upgrades on the game, for all science structures. @Mozeen
* Podarium progression and utility of mutated plants by product. @relaxitshandled
* Podarium utility details (if any?) at launch and prior to the morphopod feature implementation. @Mozeen
* (future) Illuvial training and stat reroll mechanism details. @Mozeen
* The percentage of Biodata per Region align with the bonding curve, or is it influenced by the discovery of blueprints; ie. the more Y type of blueprint has been minted the less chance that Y biodata will be found? @torrex_ilv
* When scanning for biodata, will each scan have a fuel cost, and does it increase with tiers? @torrex_ilv

## Appendix B
* Element/Fuel Converters are inconsistent in the duration and amount of passive generation. This impairs the landholder’s plot performance and eliminates the ability for the supply Labs with feedback.
* Element/Fuel Converters do not allow collecting passive generation while active generation is in progress. Using “repeat” completely prevents you from collecting this.
* Veteran players reportedly inconsistently reduce path time. This could be due to ignorance or unclarity on a minor tactical understanding, such as the path must remain continuous versus connected to an active-performing set of squares. This should not be ambiguous and left to interpretation of in-game pop-ups.
* Singularity Scanners do not have time reduction from paths applied to the scan activity.
* Issues specific to a single land plot unable to load or having structures that become unresponsive as if they have an ongoing activity.
* Weekly goals do not reflect progress when completing daily goals.
* Lands that are purchased on the Illuvidex do not migrate properly with all fuel sites operating leading to the need to reset the plots.
