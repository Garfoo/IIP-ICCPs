## Simple Summary
This proposal adjusts the pricing mechanics for Illuvium Beyond Wave 3 and all subsequent waves by pegging D1SK prices directly to USD. This ensures stable and predictable pricing for players. Any future adjustments to this system will require a separate ICCP.

## Abstract
To enhance pricing consistency and accessibility, this proposal introduces a direct USD peg for D1SK pricing starting from Wave 3. The ETH equivalent for each D1SK type will be dynamically calculated at the time of purchase using a real-time price oracle. The pricing structure, including ratios and product tiers, remains unchanged.

## Overview
Beginning with Wave 3, all D1SK prices will be pegged to USD to provide stable pricing regardless of ETH market fluctuations. This approach ensures players have a predictable and straightforward purchasing experience. The pricing will be as follows:

- Standard D1SK: $5.99
- Mega D1SK: $35.94
- Alpha Standard D1SK: $11.99
- Alpha Mega D1SK: $107.91

The ETH equivalent will be calculated in real-time at the point of purchase. This adjustment will remain in effect for future waves unless revised by a subsequent ICCP.

### Sale Mechanics Adjustments
**USD Peg for Pricing**

Prices for all D1SKS are fixed to USD values as detailed above.
Real-time ETH conversions will be performed at the time of purchase using a reliable price oracle.

### Applicability to Future Waves
This USD peg pricing model will apply to Wave 3 and all subsequent waves unless explicitly modified by a new ICCP.

## Rationale
Pegging D1SK prices to USD ensures pricing stability, enhances player confidence, and aligns with broader accessibility goals for Illuvium Beyond. By eliminating the impact of ETH price fluctuations, this system simplifies the purchase process and creates a more inclusive experience for the community.
